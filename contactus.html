		<p>The Youth Project is created by a group of high skilled engineers who have worked as team leaders, CXO's and professional developers, and have felt the need to do something about the problem with the current workforce. We realized that in today's industry, "BEING FRESHER IS A MYTH." Companies have right money to give to the skilled professionals but not enough to train them for a certain skills. It is this gap in the industry which is leading to unemployed crowd, slow development cycles in company due to lack of resources and eventually a slow economy at large.</p>
